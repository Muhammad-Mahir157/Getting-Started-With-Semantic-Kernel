# Getting-Started-With-Semantic-Kernel
# AI Agents with Microsoft Azure OpenAI & Semantic Kernel

This project demonstrates how to build AI agents using **Microsoft Azure OpenAI** and **Semantic Kernel**, following the Microsoft Learning Path: *Develop AI Agents Using Azure OpenAI and the Semantic Kernel SDK*. The goal is to showcase the integration of AI capabilities into enterprise applications, including prompt engineering, automation, and the creation of intelligent agents.

## Features

- **AI Agent Development**: Implement AI agents capable of natural language processing and task automation.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Improve AI interactions by refining prompts and using nested functions.
- **Custom Plugins**: Create and integrate custom native plugins for the Semantic Kernel.
- **Automation with Planners**: Automate complex workflows using Semantic Kernel planners.
